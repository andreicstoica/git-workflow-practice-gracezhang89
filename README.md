[Front-End Principles for Designers](https://jonyablonski.com/articles/2015/front-end-principles-for-designers/)

This article is interesting to me because it provides a solid high-level overview of what a designer may need to know to effectively work with a developer. It also links to multiple resources which explain more each concept more in-depth.
